                    <h3>UX Design Internship at Onshape</h3><br>
                    <p>This past summer I was lucky enough to work remotely as a user experience
                        designer at <a href="https://www.onshape.com/">Onshape</a>. I worked on improvement
                        requests, analyzing relevant support tickets to determine
                        the most common use cases for that feature. I then used Figma to create mockups
                        and test them out, both internally on other Onshape employees or interns, and externally
                        on real Onshape users. Based on the test results, I would modify the mockups until
                        I found the best solution. Several of the changes I worked on are currently either
                        in the Onshape product or in development to go out in future releases. <br><br>
                        At this internship I gained an extensive knowledge of Figma and learned how to conduct
                        user interviews and handle them professionally even when they didn't go smoothly.
                        I also learned about what is really important when designing user experience. For more on this,
                        see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/users-experience-how-onshape-does-ux-right-annabelle-platt/">blog post</a>
                        about my experience and my views on UX in general.

                    <h3>Building a Plankton Identification Algorithm in MATLAB</h3><br>
                    <p>This is probably my favorite project I've ever done. As a final project for the
                    linear algebra unit in the course Quantitative Engineering Analysis, <b>I built an
                    algorithm that uses linear algebra and Principal Component Analysis to identify plankton.</b>
                    <br><br>To accomplish this, I used images of plankton from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
                    (found <a href="https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/7341">here</a>)
                    to train and test the algorithm, and used MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox to process the images.
                    I used the Fourier descriptor method described in <a href="http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/2006/JOE06_plankton.pdf">this paper</a>,
                    followed by PCA to classify the plankton. <b>For full details on this, see my

                    <h3>Designing a Play Experience for 4th Graders</h3><br>
                    <p>My final project for the course Design Nature was to build a play experience for
                        4th graders inspired by an animal. My group was assigned the archerfish, which
                        hunt by squirting water from their mouths to knock bugs off branches. <b>Team work and effective
                        communication were absolutely critical for this project, as over the course of seven weeks,
                        my group designed, prototyped, and built an experience.</b> In our design, 4th graders would
                        play as an archerfish trapped in an aquarium that needed to shoot "water" (in the form of
                        hand-sewn beanbags) to knock down the keys and escape. <br><br>The archerfish that we built
                        (shown in the image to the left) was a turreted slingshot. The turret allowed rotation both side
                        to side and up and down. Requiring this to be done at the same time as operating the slingshot
                        was a design choice to necessitate teamwork. <b>During our final exam period, real 4th graders
                        came to test out our experience.</b> Seeing them successfully navigate the experience and walk away
                        proclaiming that "That was fun!" was an incredibly gratifying experience that brought home
                        how far we had come from scribbled designs on a white board to a reality that 4th graders would enjoy.
