                    a cloud-based Product Lifecycle Management company.</p>
                <p>I design, mockup, and user-test new features and feature improvements.
                    My work is primarily done in Sketch, using Sketch Cloud
                    for revision control. I also work with the developers as the feature is being implemented to
                    resolve any UX questions that come up and to manually QA the feature once finished.
                    In addition to all this, I do graphic design and icon design to ensure
                    a cohesive, professional look across the product.</p>

                <h3 id="Onshape"><b>Onshape</b></h3>
                <p>Onshape is a cloud-base CAD software changing the way engineers do CAD. I worked at
                    Onshape for the summers of 2020 and 2021, first as a user experience intern, then as a software
                    engineering intern. Both my designs and my code are currently in the Onshape product.
                </p>
                <p>During my first summer at Onshape I worked as a user experience design intern. I identified key elements
                    from user feature requests, then used Figma to create mockups and test them out on both other Onshape
                    employees and real Onshape users. Based on the test results and feedback from design reviews, I
                    iterated on the mockups until I found the best solution. I wrote an article about my experience and my
                    views on UX design which can be found
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/users-experience-how-onshape-does-ux-right-annabelle-platt/">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>During my second summer at Onshape I worked as a software engineering intern on the
                    data management team. I worked with Java, HTML, CSS, and Typescript to fix bugs and implement
                    new features. I learned to navigate and debug in a large code base, submit and contribute to code reviews,
                    and work with Git in a professional
                    environment.

                <p>Ipswich River Watershed Association is an organization that seeks to protect the Ipswich River
                    through legislation, conservation, and education.</p>
                <p>I worked at IRWA during the summer of 2019 as an education apprentice. During my time there
                    I worked with summer camps and educational groups, leading paddles on the Ipswich River
                    and teaching about water conservation. I also visited local farmer's markets and attended
                    other outreach events to teach children and adults about the river, where their water comes
                    from, the importance of conserving it, and the dangers of stormwater. In my spare time,
                    I worked on developing the organizationâ€™s new website and updating resources about town water
                    systems to make water quality information more accessible to the public.

                <p>During the summer of 2018 I worked as a robotics intern at Analog Devices,
                    building RC cars to use as testbeds for developing autonomous vehicle sensors.
                    This was my first big exposure to deciphering documentation and applying it to
                    my own project. My job was primarily in adjusting the hardware and electrical
                    systems to optimize the car for office testing. I designed circuits to integrate the components
                    and CADed the structural housing. I also wrote Python scripts to interact with the
                    Robot Operating System (ROS) and learned to develop in a Unix system.
